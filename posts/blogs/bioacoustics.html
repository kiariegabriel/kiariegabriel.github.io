                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            Climate change and human encroachment are a major threat to ecosystems around the world especially 
                            in the tropics. The tropics are characterised with one of the richest biodiversity on the planet. 
                            This means that the effects of climate change will be felt most in ecosystems found within the tropics. 
                            Urgent conservation efforts need to be increased in order to preserve these ecosystems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Increase in temperatures due to global warming and habitat loss due to human encroachment is greatly 
                            affecting bird populations. It is estimated that over the next 100 years, 20 percent to 30 percent of 
                            bird species will be extinct. Majority of these are birds found in the tropics. As temperatures rise 
                            and habitats are lost, animals tend to migrate in search of new and cool habitats. By studying these 
                            trends, we can learn about the changes taking place in the ecosystems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Birds respond quickly to changes taking place in their ecosystems. This makes them to be one of the most
                            suitable species to use as an indicator of the changes taking place in ecosystems. We can infer about other
                            species within a given ecosystem by studying the trends of bird species. A decline or absence of a bird species 
                            that used to be found in a given ecosystem would indicate a change in that ecosystem hence calling for its 
                            conservation.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Monitoring ecosystems</h2>

                        <p>
                            Current trends in ecosystems call for them to be closely monitored in order to preserve them. Traditional 
                            methods of monitoring the ecosystems that involve carrying out surveys are time consuming, expensive and 
                            are sometimes affected by other factors like inaccessibility of some parts and weather. Therefore, alternative 
                            and better methods of monitoring the ecosystems need to be devised.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Bioacoustic monitoring of ecosystems provides a potential remedy to the hurdles faced when using surveys to 
                            monitor ecosystems. Most animals, like human beings, use sound as one of their means of communication. It is 
                            possible to identify different bird species by the sound they produce. This means that we can monitor birds by 
                            listening to the sound they make.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Advancement in technology has seen development of handheld devices that can be used to record good quality sound. 
                            Using these devices, we can collect acoustic data in ecosystems of interest and use it in studying the species 
                            found in them. The AudioMoth and the Raspberry Pi are examples of devices that can be used in collecting acoustic 
                            data for ecosystems monitoring. Figure 1 below shows the AudioMoth and the Raspberry Pi.

                        <h2>Automatic acoustic classification of bird species</h2>

                        <p>
                            Acoustic monitoring of ecosystems provides a means to study ecosystems with minimal disturbance 
                            and over wide areas. Decrease in cost of recording instruments has made it easier to expand acoustic 
                            monitoring of ecosystems from just proof of concept studies to actual study of biodiversity. Acoustic 
                            sensors can be deployed in most parts of the ecosystems to record sound that is then used to study the 
                            ecosystems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ecosystems have a vast amount of acoustic data that can be used to study trends in them. Manual analysis 
                            of this data may prove to be cumbersome and time consuming. Sampling of the data may introduce bias and 
                            incompleteness in the analysis. However, use of acoustic sensors with the ability to classify species 
                            automatically from their vocalisation can help solve this problem. Automatic acoustic classification of 
                            birds leverages digital signal processing and machine learning techniques to classify different species 
                            based on their vocalisations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Birds are one of the most vocal species in the ecosystems. The sound produced by a bird contains features 
                            that are unique to its species. Using digital signal processing, we can extract these features and identify 
                            different species from the sound they produce. The feature of interest in acoustic classification is the 
                            frequency component of the sound.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Python programming language makes it possible to carry out digital signal processing in software. The frequency 
                            components of a sound recording can be extracted and plotted against time using Python. This plot is called a 
                            spectrogram. Figure 2 below shows spectrograms of the Hartlaub's Turacos and Grey-backed Camaroptera's recording 
                            obtained from Dedan Kimathi University of Technology Conservancy.

                        <p>
                            From figure 2, we can see the plots are different from each other. Therefore, we can classify birds by extracting 
                            the frequency component of their sound and plotting a spectrogram. The spectrogram can then be treated as an image 
                            and fed to a machine learning model as an input for classification.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A system that records sound, processes it and identifies the species in the recordings would be an ideal system to 
                            carry out acoustic monitoring of birds for the purpose of ecosystems conservation. At Centre for Data Science and 
                            Artificial Intelligence (DSAIL) , we have designed the DSAIL Bioacoustics System that is based on the Raspberry Pi 
                            single computer. The system is designed to record and save time stamped audio data of birds. The data will be used 
                            to develop machine learning models to classify birds automatically based on their vocalizations. With enough and 
                            labeled acoustic data, we can leverage machine learning to automatically classify birds in ecosystems of interest.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                        <p>
                            Severe degradation of ecosystems has affected different species negatively around 
                            the world. Conservation efforts need to be increased to preserve these ecosystems. 
                            Birds are one of the best species to use when studying the ecosystems since they 
                            respond quickly to changes taking place in the ecosystems. Automatic acoustic 
                            classification of birds provides a tool to continuously monitor ecosystems. Using 
                            the data obtained from the acoustic systems, we can study the trends of bird species 
                            in ecosystems of interest and infer about the states of these ecosystems.
