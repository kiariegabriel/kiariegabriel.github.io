                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            Climate change and human expansion have resulted in degradation of the biosphere. This 
                            has posed a great threat to biodiversity. Africa has one of the most diverse fauna on 
                            the globe. Uncontrolled human activities and the fact that the effects of climate change 
                            are most felt within the tropics means the rich biodiversity is at risk. This calls for 
                            increased conservation efforts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To effectively conserve ecosystems, we need to monitor their current states and the changes 
                            taking place in them. This means that we need to collect data from them and analyse it. 
                            Traditionally, data is collected from ecosystems by carrying out physical surveys. This is 
                            where ecologists and researchers go to the field to observe the ecological community in its 
                            natural state. Due to the extensive nature of the environment, physical surveys require a lot 
                            of human labour and are, therefore, expensive. This makes it hard to carry them out 
                            continuously and hence are done periodically. Therefore, we have to devise other efficient 
                            ways of collecting data continuously from the ecosystems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Acoustic monitoring of animals is one of the non-invasive methods of monitoring wildlife 
                            continuously. The method entails recording sounds of animals in a given habitat and analysing 
                            them to determine the presence of a given species <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> . Animals produce 
                            characteristic calls that can be used to identify them using the recordings only 
                            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>  . An expert taking a walk in the park can tell different animals 
                            from the sound they produce only even without seeing them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Advancement in technology has seen development of handheld devices that can be used to record 
                            sound. Using these devices, we can develop acoustic sensor systems and deploy them in the field 
                            to collect acoustic data. This will enable us to continuously monitor our ecosystems remotely.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the <a href="https://dekut-dsail.github.io/"
                            target="_blank">Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAIL)</a>, 
                            <a href="https://www.dkut.ac.ke/"
                            target="_blank">Dedan Kimathi University of Technology</a>, we have developed a Raspberry Pi 
                            based acoustic sensor that will be used in acoustic monitoring of bird species. In the 
                            following sections, I will describe the acoustic sensor.
                        </p>

                        <h2>DSAIL Bioacoustics System</h2>

                        <p>
                            The DSAIL Bioacoustics System is a Raspberry Pi based acoustic sensor that was developed at 
                            DSAIL. The system was developed with the aim to collect acoustic data of birds and also 
                            perform automatic classification of birds from their vocalizations. Currently, we have been 
                            able to successfully deploy the system at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology Conservancy 
                            for data collection. We are looking forward to coming back to narrate the story of how we have 
                            successfully classified various birds at our conservancy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Back to what this blog is about, the DSAIL Bioacoustics System can be divided into two; 
                            hardware and software. The hardware is the physical part of the system whereas the software 
                            is a set of instructions that control the performance of the hardware. Now, let us dive into 
                            each of these components and see how they complete the system
                        </p>

                        <h3>Hardware</h3>

                        <p>
                            The main parts that make up the hardware are the Raspberry Pi, power source, power supply 
                            board, the microphone and mounting mast.
                        </p>

                        <h4>i. The Raspberry Pi</h4>

                        <p>
                            The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"
                            target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>  is an inexpensive single board computer that was developed 
                            as an educational tool but has found broad applications. The Raspberry Pi is the central 
                            device that controls the acoustic sensor and is used to record and save audio.
                        </p>

                        <h4>ii. Power source</h4>

                        <p>
                            Our acoustic sensor will almost always be deployed far away from the from the grid. This 
                            means we have to look for alternative means of powering the system. The system is powered 
                            using a solar power system that comprises a solar panel and a battery. The solar panel is 
                            used to convert solar energy into electricity that is stored in the battery. The stored 
                            energy is used to power the system even in absence of the sun. Kenya sits right at the 
                            equator and, therefore, receives ample sunshine throughout the year which means our system 
                            can run for a very long period without the battery running out of juice.
                        </p>

                        <h4>iii. Power supply board</h4>

                        <p>
                            This was one of the most important parts of the design. Sun as a source of energy is 
                            characterized by intermittence like most of the other renewable sources of energy. 
                            Intermittency in solar energy is brought about by days that are cloudy and nights when there 
                            is no sunlight. Therefore, there is a need to continuously monitor the status of the battery 
                            to prevent the Raspberry Pi shutting down due to the battery getting drained. Shutting the 
                            Raspberry Pi abruptly due to loss of power may result in corruption of its storage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The power supply board was designed to enable the Raspberry Pi to monitor the level of the 
                            battery and make an informed decision of when to shut down i.e. when the battery voltage drops 
                            to the cut-off voltage. The board is also able to switch the Raspberry Pi back on after the 
                            battery has been recharged. This was a milestone achievement in that one can deploy the system 
                            and leave it in the wild for a long period without having to worry about power fluctuations 
                            affecting the system. Ideally it is a fit and forget system if you could ask me.
                        </p>


                        <h4>iv. USB microphone</h4>

                        <p>
                            The USB microphone is used together with the Raspberry Pi to record sound. The USB microphone 
                            used has a soundcard to sample the sound and feed it to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi 
                            does not take in analog inputs hence the choice of the microphone.
                        </p>

                        <h4>v. Mounting mast</h4>

                        <p>
                            This is the structure used to hold the system during deployment. The mast is a long metal rod 
                            and it has an adapter box attached to it to house the acoustic sensor and a rail on top where 
                            the solar panel rests.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Software</h3>

                        <p>
                            For our acoustic sensor, we have developed two main programs to control the operation of the 
                            hardware. The first program is the power management program and the second one is the audio data 
                            collection program. In the following sections, we will go through the two programs.
                        </p>

                        <h4></h4>

                        
                        <h4>i.	Power management program</h4>
    
                        <p>
                            This is the program responsible for enabling the Raspberry Pi to control the Power supply board. 
                            The program enables the Raspberry Pi to monitor the status of the battery and to initiate the 
                            shutdown protocol of the entire system whenever the battery voltage gets to the cut-off voltage. 
                            The program also sets an alarm on the DS3231 alarm incorporated in the power supply board to 
                            wake the Raspberry Pi later after the battery has been recharged. Currently, the system is also 
                            designed to operate for a certain period of time during the day. Therefore, the decision to 
                            shutdown the system is based either on the level of the battery or the time of the day.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This program enables the Raspberry Pi to record audio. The program is designed such that it 
                            makes the Raspberry Pi to stream audio continuously but only saves segments of the stream that 
                            contain acoustic activities. This is done by comparing the energy of small blocks of the stream 
                            with the mean of energies of blocks of sound recorded during a silent condition. Blocks that 
                            exhibit energy that is more than two standard deviations away from this mean are considered to 
                            contain acoustic activity and are saved as recordings.

                        <h2> Deployment</h2>
    
                        <p>
                            After the acoustic sensor and the programs to run it were developed, we deployed it at the 
                            conservancy for data collection. We have been able to record about a hundred hours of audio. 
                            The data contains sounds of birds and non-birds sounds. We are looking forward to having the 
                            data cleaned and annotated and use it in developing machine learning (ML) models for automatic 
                            acoustic classification of bird species.
                        </p>
    
                        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
    
                        <p>
                            The DSAIL Bioacoustics System is an acoustic system that has been tailored at DSAIL. The system 
                            has so far been successfully deployed for acoustic data collection. Soon we will have the 
                            acoustic sensor loaded with ML models for acoustic classification of birds and have it out in 
                            the field monitoring birds for wildlife conservation. This will greatly beef up the current 
                            conservation efforts.
