                        <h3> Introduction</h3>

                        <p>
                            One of the most crucial factors when designing sensors to deploy in the field is power. The main
                            challenge is usually to lengthen the time of operation of the sensors since most of them are
                            battery powered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and powerful single board computer that finds many
                            applications in sensor systems. It can be configured to work with high-specification hardware
                            and consumes less power. When designing a Raspberry Pi system to deploy in the field, the
                            problem of powering the system needs to be handled carefully. Like in normal computers, there is
                            constant reading and writing on to the storage of the Raspberry Pi. This means that care needs
                            to be taken when shutting down the Raspberry Pi. Abrupt disconnection from power may result in
                            corruption and hence loss of data in its storage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When designing the <a href="https://www.dkut.ac.ke/" target="_blank">DSAIL Bioacoustics
                                System</a>. (that is
                            based on the Raspberry Pi single board
                            computer), the first step was to design a circuit to power the Raspberry Pi intelligently. The
                            system is powered by a solar panel and a lithium battery. In the following sections, we will
                            look at the design of the circuit.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Requirements of the design</h3>

                        <p>
                            The circuit design for powering the Raspberry Pi was to meet the following requirements:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide the Raspberry Pi with a constant voltage (5.1V),</li>
                            <li>Enable the Raspberry Pi to monitor the voltage of the battery,</li>
                            <li>Provide the Raspberry Pi with the ability to shut down the system,</li>
                            <li>A mechanism to wake the system after the battery has recharged </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Provide the Raspberry Pi with a constant voltage</h5>

                        <p>
                            The Raspberry Pi operates at a voltage of 5.1V. For proper performance of the Raspberry Pi, it
                            is necessary to provide it with the rated voltage. Our system uses a 3.7V lithium battery. To
                            obtain 5.1V from the battery, we used a boost converter to step up the dc voltage.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Enable the Raspberry Pi to monitor the voltage of the battery
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            Lithium cells are not constant voltage generators. The voltage of a cell drops as charge is
                            being drawn from it. Using this fact, we can monitor the <a href="#State of charge (SOC)">state
                                of
                                charge</a> (SOC) of the battery.
                            Monitoring the voltage of the battery was a crucial requirement for our design. One reason is to
                            ensure that the Raspberry Pi does not shut down due to the battery getting drained. The other
                            reason is to lengthen the life of the battery by preventing over discharge.
                            The board employs the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/mcp3008-spi-adc/python-circuitpython"
                                target="_blank">MCP3008</a> analog to digital converter (ADC) to enable the Raspberry to
                            read
                            the voltage of the battery. The Raspberry Pi lacks an onboard ADC hence cannot read the voltage
                            which is an analog quantity. The ADC samples the voltage reading of the battery and feeds a
                            digital form of the reading to the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO pins. Using the voltage
                            reading, the Raspberry Pi is able to monitor the SOC of the battery and shutdown the system
                            whenever the voltage drops to the rated <a href="#Cut-off voltage">cut-off voltage</a> of the
                            battery. This ensures that the
                            battery never goes below the rated cut-off voltage (2.8V for our battery) hence lengthening its
                            life cycle.

                        </p>

                        <h5>Provide the Raspberry Pi with the ability to shut down the
                            system
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            When the voltage of the battery drops to the cut-off voltage, the entire system needs to be shut
                            down. This should be done in a way that accommodates for safe shutdown of the Raspberry Pi. To
                            achieve this, we used a combination of a 555 timer and a decade counter. The timer is connected
                            in astable mode to produce a square wave of period 4s. The output of the timer is fed to a
                            decade counter. The decade counter tenth output pin is used to trigger the shutdown of the
                            entire system. The aim of this setup is to delay the disconnection of the system from power to
                            give the Raspberry Pi enough time to shut down in the conventional way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When the Raspberry Pi has ‘decided’ to shutdown, it triggers a <a href="#Thyristor">thyristor
                            </a> that connects the <a href="#555-timer">555 timer
                            </a>
                            and decade counter circuit to power. The timer starts producing pulses that are counted by
                            the decade counter. On the tenth pulse, the tenth pin of the <a href="#Decade counter">decade
                                counter
                            </a> disconnects the
                            entire system from power. The decade counter’s output triggers a transistor that withdraws
                            momentarily the anode current of the thyristor connecting the entire system to power hence
                            shutting the entire system. The entire process of shutting down the entire system takes
                            approximately 40s since we count ten pulses of period 4s each before the system is shut down.
                            This gives the Raspberry Pi more than enough time to shutdown safely before the power is
                            disconnected.
                        </p>

                        <h5>A mechanism to wake the system after the battery has recharged
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            After the system has shut down, the battery is will be charged by the solar panel. The system
                            should then wake up and start operating. To achieve this, we incorporated a <a
                                href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds3231-precision-rtc-breakout/overview"
                                target="_blank">DS3231
                            </a>
                            real time clock(RTC) on the board. The RTC is equipped with an alarm interrupt that can be
                            utilized to
                            schedule the wake up of the system. Before the Raspberry Pi shuts down, it sets the alarm of the
                            RTC to schedule for the time it should wake up. When the time of the RTC matches that of the set
                            alarm, the alarm interrupt is used to trigger the system to wake it up. The RTC is also helpful
                            in setting the time of the Raspberry Pi since it lacks an onboard RTC. This is especially
                            important for timestamping the saved bird audio recordings.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Design of the DSAIL Power Management Board</h3>

                        <p>
                            Guided by the above requirements, we designed the DSAIL Power management board using basic
                            electrical and electronic components. The design was first carried out on <a
                                href="https://www.labcenter.com/" target="_blank">Proteus
                            </a> software.
                            Proteus is a simulation software that is used in the design of electrical circuits and printed
                            circuit boards (PCB). Use of simulation software in designing helps one to analyse the
                            performance and suitability of a design without actually making the prototype using the actual
                            components. This makes it cheaper, faster and increases flexibility of the design process.
                        </p>

                        <br></br>

                        <p>
                            After designing the circuit on Proteus, we acquired the components that were required for the
                            design. The components were obtained from <a href="https://www.pixelelectric.com/"
                                target="_blank">Pixel Electric Engineering
                                Ltd
                            </a> and <a href="https://store.nerokas.co.ke/" target="_blank">Nerokas Engineering Solutions.
                            </a>
                            The circuit was first prototyped on a <a href="#Breadboard"> breadboard.
                            </a> Once we were comfortable with
                            design, we proceeded to making a printed circuit board for the circuit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the PCB design, we used <a href="https://kicad.org/" target="_blank"> KiCad
                            </a>software. KiCad enables one to design a schematic of an
                            electronic circuit and then convert it to a PCB design. The PCB design is then then exported as
                            a PDF and printed on an A4 paper with toner (photograph paper, mate). The toner is then placed
                            on the copper clad board face down and then the printed tracks of the PCB design are transferred
                            to the board using a hot iron box. Using special chemicals, the copper on the board is removed
                            leaving only the parts that have been covered by the toner. This forms the copper tracks for
                            electrical conduction of the board. This process is called etching.
                        </p>

                            After the etching process is complete, the components can now be placed on the board and
                            soldered. We transferred the components and soldered them carefully. We then tested the board
                            and it successfully powered our Raspberry Pi as expected. It was an achievement!!! Figure 3
                            below shows the DSAIL Power Management Board.

                            and to initiate the process of shutting down the system.

                        <p>
                            We have deployed the system for testing and also for collecting acoustic data of birds. The
                            system performed efficiently during the initial deployments at <a href="https://www.dkut.ac.ke/"
                                target="_blank"> Dedan Kimathi University ofTechnology</a>. The system was set to operate
                            during a certain window of time in a day due to power
                            constraint. The system wakes up at 5 am and operates up to 11 am when birds are most active and
                            then shuts down for the battery to charge. During this period, the system was able to shut down
                            as expected. The Raspberry Pi was also able to successfully monitor the voltage profile of the
                            battery when the system was operating. Figure 5 below show the voltage profile of the battery
                            during the deployment at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology Conservancy from 16th to 20th
                            November, 2020.

                        <p>
                            From figure 5 above, we can observe the discharge and charging of the battery. It can also be
                            observed that the voltage of the battery always started at a value higher than the voltage
                            before the system shutdown in the previous day. This is a proof that the battery was being
                            charged when the system shut down
                        </p>


                        <h3>Future Work</h3>

                        <p>
                            The current board we are using is the first version of the DSAIL Power Management Board. We
                            intend to design improved versions of the board that will be more efficient and occupy less
                            space compared to the current version. Our intention is to design a board that can be used as a
                            hardware on top (HAT) with the Raspberry Pi.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                        <p>
                            Power is one of the most crucial factors to consider when designing sensors to deploy in the
                            field. It is even more important when it comes to systems that are based on the Raspberry Pi.
                            Care needs to be taken to ensure that the Raspberry Pi does not shut down due to batteries used
                            to power it getting drained. At DSAIL, we designed the DSAIL Power Management Board to power the
                            Raspberry Pi intelligently. The board ensures that the Raspberry Pi can monitor the battery and
                            shutdown whenever the battery voltage drops to the cut-off voltage. The board also enables the
                            Raspberry Pi to schedule the time it intends the system to wake up after the battery has been
                            charged by a solar panel. Therefore, the DSAIL Power Management Board is an efficient design for
                            powering the Raspberry Pi in the field.

                            by applying a gate signal on its gate. The SCR remains ON even after the gate signal is
                            withdrawn (latching) provided the anode current is above the holding current (threshold value of
                            current below which an SCR turns OFF). One of the ways of turning the thyristor off is by
