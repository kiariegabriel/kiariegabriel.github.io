I am a research intern at the Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAIL) in Dedan Kimathi University of Technology. I have expirience in Digital Signal Processing, Bioacoustics, programming in Python, Machine Learning and Data Science and fabricating systems for data collection for machine learning purposes.

I am driven by the passion to develop solutions to the problems we face in our every day live using data science. I am especially interested in using data science and machine learning in studying the ecosystem with the intention of conserving it.

Currently, I am working on a project to classify birds automatically based on their vocalization. I have developed an acoustic system that is able to detect acoustic activty of birds and save their vocalizations. I intends to use the audio data to develop a machine learning model to automatically classify birds for the purpose of studying the ecosystem.
