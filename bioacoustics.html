                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Climate change and human encroachment are a major threat to ecosystems around the world
                            especially in the tropics. The tropics are characterized with one of the richest biodiversity on
                            the planet. This means that the effects of climate change will be felt most in ecosystems found
                            within the tropics. Urgent conservation efforts need to be increased in order to preserve these
                            ecosystems.
                        </p>
    
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Increase in temperatures due to global warming and habitat loss due to human encroachment is
                            greatly affecting bird populations. It is estimated that over the next 100 years, 20 percent to
                            30 percent of bird species will be extinct. Majority of these are birds found in the tropics. As
                            temperatures rise and habitats are lost, animals tend to migrate in search of new and cool
                            habitats. By studying these trends, we can learn about the changes taking place in the
                            ecosystems.
                        </p>

                            Birds respond quickly to changes taking place in their ecosystems. This makes them to be one of
                            the most suitable species to use as an indicator of the changes taking place in ecosystems. We
                            can infer about other species within a given ecosystem by studying the trends of bird species. A
                            decline or absence of a bird species that used to be found in a given ecosystem would indicate a
                            change in that ecosystem hence calling for its conservation.

                            Current trends in ecosystems call for them to be closely monitored in order to preserve them.
                            Traditional methods of monitoring the ecosystems that involve carrying out surveys are time
                            consuming, expensive and are sometimes affected by other factors like inaccessibility of some
                            parts and weather. Therefore, alternative and better methods of monitoring the ecosystems need
                            to be devised.

                            Bioacoustic monitoring of ecosystems provides a potential remedy to the hurdles faced when using
                            surveys to monitor ecosystems. Most animals, like human beings, use sound as one of their means
                            of communication. It is possible to identify different bird species by the sound they produce.
                            This means that we can monitor birds by listening to the sound they make.

                            Advancement in technology has seen development of handheld devices that can be used to record
                            good quality sound. Using these devices, we can collect acoustic data in ecosystems of interest
                            and use it in studying the species found in them. The AudioMoth and the Raspberry Pi are
                            examples of devices that can be used in collecting acoustic data for ecosystems monitoring.

                            Acoustic monitoring of ecosystems provides a means to study ecosystems with minimal disturbance
                            and over wide areas. Decrease in cost of recording instruments has made it easier to expand
                            acoustic monitoring of ecosystems from just proof of concept studies to actual study of
                            biodiversity. Acoustic sensors can be deployed in most parts of the ecosystems to record sound
                            that is then used to study the ecosystems.
                        </p>

                            Ecosystems have a vast amount of acoustic data that can be used to study trends in them. Manual
                            analysis of this data may prove to be cumbersome and time consuming. Sampling of the data may
                            introduce bias and incompleteness in the analysis. However, use of acoustic sensors with the
                            ability to classify species automatically from their vocalization can help solve this problem.
                            Automatic acoustic classification of birds leverages digital signal processing and machine
                            learning techniques to classify different species based on their vocalizations.

                            Birds are one of the most vocal species in the ecosystems. The sound produced by a bird contains
                            features that are unique to its species. Using digital signal processing, we can extract these
                            features and identify different species from the sound they produce. The feature of interest in
                            acoustic classification is the frequency component of the sound.

                            Severe degradation of ecosystems has affected different species negatively around the world.
                            Conservation efforts need to be increased to preserve these ecosystems. Birds are one of the
                            best species to use when studying the ecosystems since they respond quickly to changes taking
